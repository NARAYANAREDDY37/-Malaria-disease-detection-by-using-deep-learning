# -Malaria-disease-detection-by-using-deep-learning
Malaria is a deadly, infectious, mosquito-borne disease caused  by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted by the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The main aim of this project is to create a model which can detect this deadly disease by using one of deep learning techniques called transfer nueral networs
